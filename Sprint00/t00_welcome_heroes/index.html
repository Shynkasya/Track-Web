		<h2 id = "anchor">What makes a superhero?</h2>
		<p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t.

Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero. For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.<br><br><i>Article on superheroes at </i><a href = "https://blog.oup.com/2018/11/stan-lee-what-is-a-superhero/">OUP blog</a></p>
